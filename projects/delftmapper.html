          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>DelftMapper was a semester-long project for the Municipality of Delft, created as part of the Smart Society User Experience Design course. The tool is a web-based mapping platform for urban professionals, allowing them to display, combine, and toggle multiple datasets in real-time. With its interactive timeline, users can scroll through years of data to see both historical context and future plans. The tool enables professionals to spot overlaps, address conflicts, and collaborate directly through online discussion threads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Urban development projects in Delft involve many stakeholders and complex datasets. Professionals currently rely on fragmented GIS tools that are powerful but difficult to use, or on static documents that lack interactivity. The municipality challenged our team to design a user-friendly tool that would bring these data sources together in one interactive platform, while also fostering collaboration.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Key Challenges:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplifying professional GIS complexity into an accessible interface</li>
            <li>Supporting multiple layers of data visualization (maps, charts, statistics)</li>
            <li>Providing tools for discussion and collaboration across stakeholders</li>
            <li>Creating a scalable prototype aligned with the municipality's brand identity</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
          <p>Our team began with benchmarking existing tools such as QGIS, ArcGIS Online, and pdok.nl. We identified both powerful features to draw inspiration from (layer management, dashboards) and pain points to avoid (steep learning curve, cluttered UIs).</p>
          
          <p>We also conducted interviews with potential users, including urban planners, students, and municipal advisors. Key insights included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users wanted clarity and simplicity over feature-heavy complexity</li>
            <li>Collaboration was missing in current tools, but considered essential</li>
            <li>A visual timeline would help planners understand historical context and predict overlaps</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>We worked in sprints using a Scrum framework:</p>
          
          <h3>Sprint 0 – Discovery</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducted benchmarking and interviews</li>
            <li>Defined user stories, product vision, and design problem</li>
            <li>Delivered initial concepts to the client</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Sprint 1 – Ideation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Used creative techniques like "the dark side" and brainwriting to generate ideas</li>
            <li>Consolidated two initial concepts into a single vision</li>
            <li>Produced early wireframes and presented to client for feedback</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div class="project-image-gallery">

            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Sprint 2 – Prototyping</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Built mid-to-high fidelity wireframes for key features: timeline, overlaps, search, and statistics</li>
            <li>Developed a moodboard and style guide consistent with Delft's branding</li>
            <li>Delivered interactive prototypes to client</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

          <h3>Sprint 3 – Testing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Added features: data importing, visualization styles (heatmaps, bubble charts), sketching, sharing, and discussion threads</li>
            <li>Conducted usability tests with urban design students, municipal advisors, and UX lecturers</li>
            <li>Refined based on feedback (improved legends, ability to reopen threads, added amenities view)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Exposition & Final Delivery</h2>
          <p>Presented the prototype at Delft City Hall during the Smart Society exposition. Produced a final poster, video demo, and gave live demonstrations to stakeholders.</p>

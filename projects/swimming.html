          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>As a volunteer for my water polo association DSZ Wave, I took on the role of UX/UI designer to improve the club's website. The site had previously been shaped by developers within the TU Delft community, but most of the work reflected a developer-centric mindset. The technical foundation was there, yet the design lacked the aesthetics, usability, and clarity that members were looking for. Recognizing this gap, I created a complete Figma prototype to guide the redesign of the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Although developers within the association had created multiple iterations of the website, the results did not satisfy members. The main issue was that the design felt functional but visually unappealing and not user-friendly. The challenge was therefore to bring structure, consistency, and an engaging visual identity while working within the volunteer-driven context of a student sports club.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Research & Planning</h2>
          <p>To identify opportunities for improvement, I:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Benchmarked the existing DSZ Wave website against other sports association sites to understand what worked and what did not.</li>
            <li>Gathered input from fellow club members, asking what information they looked for most often (match schedules, membership info, training times, contact).</li>
            <li>Applied my design expertise to prioritize clarity and accessibility while ensuring the new design reflected the community spirit of DSZ Wave.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Design & Development</h2>
          <p>Using Figma, I built a high-fidelity prototype of the new DSZ Wave website. The design focused on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear navigation: ensuring visitors can quickly find schedules, events, and membership info.</li>
            <li>Modern visual design: professional yet approachable, with colors and layouts suited to a sports club.</li>
            <li>Consistency: using a modular design system so developers could implement the site in phases.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While the development of the site is ongoing, my prototype is being used as the blueprint for implementation. The volunteer-based nature of the project means progress is gradual, but the design ensures that once completed, the site will meet the needs of both current and future members.</p>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Provided DSZ Wave with its first professional design prototype, raising the quality of the project beyond purely technical solutions.</li>
            <li>Created alignment among members by transforming scattered feedback into a cohesive design vision.</li>
            <li>Empowered developers with a clear design system, reducing guesswork during implementation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing in a volunteer context requires flexibility and patience, as development timelines move more slowly.</li>
            <li>Even in small-scale projects, user research and benchmarking can turn informal feedback into structured design improvements.</li>
            <li>This project reinforced my ability to step into a leadership role when design expertise is missing and deliver clarity in collaborative, non-profit settings.</li>

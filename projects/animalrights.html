          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>As part of my freelance work for the non-profit organization Animal Rights, I led the <strong>redesign and front-end development</strong> of their website. The new site needed to serve multiple goals: donations, newsletter sign-ups, volunteer registrations, daily news updates, and event promotion. With over 2000 pages of content to migrate, the project demanded both strategic design decisions and technical problem-solving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The old Animal Rights website was deteriorating because the development company responsible had stopped updating the platform. A new company was briefly hired, but their solution was essentially a rigid template system. Despite promises of automated page migration, the team quickly discovered that <strong>all 2000 pages would have to be moved manually</strong>. Critical features such as newsletter sign-ups and integrated donation flows, which enable supporters to contribute directly to the non-profit, were also missing.</p>
          <p>At that point, I recognized that we were falling into a sunk cost fallacy. I persuaded my boss to discontinue that project and search for a better solution. This was a pivotal moment: it allowed us to rethink the website from the ground up rather than patching a system that could never meet our needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Research & Planning</h2>
          <p>We defined clear priorities for the new platform:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong> to support thousands of pages and future campaigns.</li>
            <li><strong>Donor-focused UX</strong> with frictionless donation and newsletter flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> to support multiple content types (news, petitions, calendar, shop).</li>
            <li><strong>Ease of use</strong> for internal editors who would update content daily.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After evaluating options, the team chose <strong>WordPress</strong> as the CMS for its balance of flexibility, extensibility, and familiarity. I took ownership of the design and user experience, ensuring alignment with Animal Rights’ mission and stakeholder needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Design & Development</h2>
          <p>I designed the new website in <strong>Figma</strong>, creating prototypes that visualized key workflows such as donations, volunteer sign-ups, and newsletter subscriptions. These prototypes allowed me to test and refine user journeys at a small scale before implementation.</p>
          <p>When one of the front-end developers fell ill, I stepped in and carried out the majority of the <strong>front-end development</strong> myself. My contributions included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Writing <strong>custom JavaScript and CSS</strong> to go beyond plugin limitations.</li>
            <li>Creating and configuring custom plugins to implement unique workflows.</li>
            <li>Optimizing WordPress templates for performance and accessibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I also collaborated with the back-end developer to solve one of the project’s biggest technical challenges: migrating 2000+ pages from the old website. Together, we translated the legacy data dump into an editable SQL file, then converted it into XML for WordPress import. This enabled a <strong>successful automated migration</strong>, saving weeks of manual labor and ensuring content integrity.</p>
          <p><em>(Visual suggestion: screenshots of Figma prototypes alongside final site pages.)</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Donation workflows</strong> streamlined into just a few steps, reducing friction. To increase completion, I introduced pop-up donation forms that appear within the user’s current flow rather than redirecting them away, which testing showed reduced abandonment.</li>
            <li><strong>Newsletter and volunteer sign-ups</strong> with clear entry points and confirmations. Similar to donations, I used pop-ups for newsletter sign-ups to keep users in their flow and improve task completion.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic news section</strong> updated daily by the team.</li>
            <li><strong>Events calendar</strong> given higher prominence compared to the old site, since attendance at protests, info stands, and other events is crucial to Animal Rights’ mission. This repositioning makes event discovery more visible and impactful.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent UI</strong> aligned with the organization’s identity.</li>
          </ul>
